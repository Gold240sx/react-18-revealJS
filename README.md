# react-18-revealJS

This project is a boilerplate for creating revealJS presentations using React.
All the basic create-react-app commands are available.

## Bugs
1. Currently includes many built in styles that override tailwind styling. ( ie: "var(--r-heading-color)" )
2. The slide arrow has a buggy looking right arrow animation. Animation needs to be re-created  debugged
